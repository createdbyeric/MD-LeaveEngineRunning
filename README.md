# Information
This lightweight script allows players to get out of the vehicle while either turning the engine off or leaving it on. If you want to leave the vehicle like normal, just press F. If you wish to leave the vehicle but leave the engine running, just hold F. 

This script is most useful for role playing servers with police departments. This scrip adds realism to police scenarios since police never turn their vehicles off.

This script has two configurable options. 
  1. Set to police vehicles only
  2. Set to leave door open when leaving vehicle with engine running.

# How To Use
1. Download via Github
2. Open Zipped Folder
3. Open 'MD-LeaveEngineRunning-main' folder
4. Drag 'md_leaveenginerunning' to your 'resources' folder
5. Add 'start md_leaveenginerunning' or 'ensure md_leaveenginerunning' (depending server version) to your server.cfg file
6. Start Server

# Support
There is no support for this script as it's a very basic script and offers barley any customization or speical features. If this script isn't working for you than either you installed it incorrectly or there has been an update to FiveM and how it handles event listeners. If that is the case, please report an issue and we will update the script for all.
